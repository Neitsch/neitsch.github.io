Capsule Networks are a novel approach for processing data with a neural network.
They were first introduced a couple years ago, but gained some
popularity after Hinton et al. published [Dynamic Routing between Capsules]
(https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829). We researched the performance of CapsNets
during our Deep Learning class. Our main findings were, that CapsNets exhibit
some desirable properties, such as resistance to Adversarial Attacks and
better adaptiveness, but are orders of magnitude slower. You can find
the full report [here](/uploads/capsnets.pdf).
