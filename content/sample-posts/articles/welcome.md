# Motivation
I've decided to start a blog for two purposes: First, I want to document my
work, so that I can go back, reflect and learn from my mistakes. Second,
others can hopefully profit from my posts. I've received so much guidance
from other blogs, now I hope to impart some of my experiences to others.

# Content
This blog will cover a wide range of Software Engineering topics. I've tried
out several languages ranging from Pascal to ReasonML and my interests are
just as widely spread. Hopefully I'll be able to cover a wide range of topics
including OS development, frontend development and machine learning.
