The\n  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n  registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n  Terminology\n  -----------\n\n  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\n  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\n  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n  itself fulfill.\n\n\n  Basic Usage:\n  ------------\n\n  ```js\n  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    // on success\n    resolve(value);\n\n    // on failure\n    reject(reason);\n  });\n\n  promise.then(function(value) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Advanced Usage:\n  ---------------\n\n  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n  `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n  ```js\n  function getJSON(url) {\n    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n      let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n      xhr.open('GET', url);\n      xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n      xhr.responseType = 'json';\n      xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n      xhr.send();\n\n      function handler() {\n        if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n          if (this.status === 200) {\n            resolve(this.response);\n          } else {\n            reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n          }\n        }\n      };\n    });\n  }\n\n  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n  ```js\n  Promise.all([\n    getJSON('/posts'),\n    getJSON('/comments')\n  ]).then(function(values){\n    values[0] // => postsJSON\n    values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n    return values;\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @class Promise\n  @param {function} resolver\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @constructor\n*/\nfunction Promise(resolver) {\n  this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\n  this._result = this._state = undefined;\n  this._subscribers = [];\n\n  if (noop !== resolver) {\n    typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n    this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n  }\n}\n\nPromise.all = all;\nPromise.race = race;\nPromise.resolve = resolve;\nPromise.reject = reject;\nPromise._setScheduler = setScheduler;\nPromise._setAsap = setAsap;\nPromise._asap = asap;\n\nPromise.prototype = {\n  constructor: Promise,\n\n  /**\n    The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n    which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n    reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n  \n    ```js\n    findUser().then(function(user){\n      // user is available\n    }, function(reason){\n      // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Chaining\n    --------\n  \n    The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n    promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n    or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n  \n    ```js\n    findUser().then(function (user) {\n      return user.name;\n    }, function (reason) {\n      return 'default name';\n    }).then(function (userName) {\n      // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n      // will be `'default name'`\n    });\n  \n    findUser().then(function (user) {\n      throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n    }, function (reason) {\n      throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n    }).then(function (value) {\n      // never reached\n    }, function (reason) {\n      // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n      // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n    });\n    ```\n    If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n  \n    ```js\n    findUser().then(function (user) {\n      throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n    }).then(function (value) {\n      // never reached\n    }).then(function (value) {\n      // never reached\n    }, function (reason) {\n      // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Assimilation\n    ------------\n  \n    Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n    retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n    fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n    until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n  \n    ```js\n    findUser().then(function (user) {\n      return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n    }).then(function (comments) {\n      // The user's comments are now available\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n  \n    ```js\n    findUser().then(function (user) {\n      return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n    }).then(function (comments) {\n      // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n    }, function (reason) {\n      // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Simple Example\n    --------------\n  \n    Synchronous Example\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let result;\n  \n    try {\n      result =

You can also use an array (for example [\"name\",\"address\"]).\n*   If an attribute has no match for the query, the raw value is returned.\n*   By default all indexed text attributes are highlighted.\n*   You can use `*` if you want to highlight all textual attributes.\n*   Numerical attributes are not highlighted.\n*   A matchLevel is returned for each highlighted attribute and can contain:\n*      - full: if all the query terms were found in the attribute,\n*      - partial: if only some of the query terms were found,\n*      - none: if none of the query terms were found.\n* - attributesToSnippet: a string that contains the list of attributes to snippet alongside\n* the number of words to return (syntax is `attributeName:nbWords`).\n*    Attributes are separated by a comma (Example: attributesToSnippet=name:10,content:10).\n*    You can also use an array (Example: attributesToSnippet: ['name:10','content:10']).\n*    By default no snippet is computed.\n* - minWordSizefor1Typo: the minimum number of characters in a query word to accept one typo in this word.\n* Defaults to 3.\n* - minWordSizefor2Typos: the minimum number of characters in a query word\n* to accept two typos in this word. Defaults to 7.\n* - getRankingInfo: if set to 1, the result hits will contain ranking\n* information in _rankingInfo attribute.\n* - aroundLatLng: search for entries around a given\n* latitude/longitude (specified as two floats separated by a comma).\n*   For example aroundLatLng=47.316669,5.016670).\n*   You can specify the maximum distance in meters with the aroundRadius parameter (in meters)\n*   and the precision for ranking with aroundPrecision\n*   (for example if you set aroundPrecision=100, two objects that are distant of\n*   less than 100m will be considered as identical for \"geo\" ranking parameter).\n*   At indexing, you should specify geoloc of an object with the _geoloc attribute\n*   (in the form {\"_geoloc\":{\"lat\":48.853409, \"lng\":2.348800}})\n* - insideBoundingBox: search entries inside a given area defined by the two extreme points\n* of a rectangle (defined by 4 floats: p1Lat,p1Lng,p2Lat,p2Lng).\n*   For example insideBoundingBox=47.3165,4.9665,47.3424,5.0201).\n*   At indexing, you should specify geoloc of an object with the _geoloc attribute\n*   (in the form {\"_geoloc\":{\"lat\":48.853409, \"lng\":2.348800}})\n* - numericFilters: a string that contains the list of numeric filters you want to\n* apply separated by a comma.\n*   The syntax of one filter is `attributeName` followed by `operand` followed by `value`.\n*   Supported operands are `<`, `<=`, `=`, `>` and `>=`.\n*   You can have multiple conditions on one attribute like for example numericFilters=price>100,price<1000.\n*   You can also use an array (for example numericFilters: [\"price>100\",\"price<1000\"]).\n* - tagFilters: filter the query by a set of tags. You can AND tags by separating them by commas.\n*   To OR tags, you must add parentheses. For example, tags=tag1,(tag2,tag3) means tag1 AND (tag2 OR tag3).\n*   You can also use an array, for example tagFilters: [\"tag1\",[\"tag2\",\"tag3\"]]\n*   means tag1 AND (tag2 OR tag3).\n*   At indexing, tags should be added in the _tags** attribute\n*   of objects (for example {\"_tags\":[\"tag1\",\"tag2\"]}).\n* - facetFilters: filter the query by a list of facets.\n*   Facets are separated by commas and each facet is encoded as `attributeName:value`.\n*   For example: `facetFilters=category:Book,author:John%20Doe`.\n*   You can also use an array (for example `[\"category:Book\",\"author:John%20Doe\"]`).\n* - facets: List of object attributes that you want to use for faceting.\n*   Comma separated list: `\"category,author\"` or array `['category','author']`\n*   Only attributes that have been added in **attributesForFaceting** index setting\n*   can be used in this parameter.\n*   You can also use `*` to perform faceting on all attributes specified in **attributesForFaceting**.\n* - queryType: select how the query words are interpreted, it can be one of the following value:\n*    - prefixAll: all query words are interpreted as prefixes,\n*    - prefixLast: only the last word is interpreted as a prefix (default behavior),\n*    - prefixNone: no query word is interpreted as a prefix. This option is not recommended.\n* - optionalWords: a string that contains the list of words that should\n* be considered as optional when found in the query.\n*   Comma separated and array are accepted.\n* - distinct: If set to 1, enable the distinct feature (disabled by default)\n* if the attributeForDistinct index setting is set.\n*   This feature is similar to the SQL \"distinct\" keyword: when enabled\n*   in a query with the distinct=1 parameter,\n*   all hits containing a duplicate value for the attributeForDistinct attribute are removed from results.\n*   For example, if the chosen attribute is show_name and several hits have\n*   the same value for show_name, then only the best\n*   one is kept and others are removed.\n* - restrictSearchableAttributes: List of attributes you want to use for\n* textual search (must be a subset of the attributesToIndex index setting)\n* either comma separated or as an array\n* @param {function} [callback] the result callback called with two arguments:\n*  error: null or Error('message').

Unfortunately it only supported iPhones. So I added an Facebook Chat connector. It still has minor issues, such as an ID not being properly resolved, but it works (in fact all those charts above are based on FB).</p>\\n<p>I have also been looking into clustering. Having the word vectors would allow us to cluster our text/chat partners and see who we interact with similarly.

Our decision fell on PostgreSQL\\nover MySQL, since we had more operational experience with former.</li>\\n<li>Backend: We powered our backend with <a href=\\\"https://www.djangoproject.com/\\\">Django</a>.\\nPython was a language that we all had worked with before, thus that\\npart was an easy decision. Then we could have either gone with Flask + SQLAlchemy\\nor Django. We chose latter, since it offered more of a all-in-one solution and\\nthus made it easier for our team. Also Django has an awesome <a href=\\\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/\\\">documentation</a>!</li>\\n<li>API: We exposed our data via <a href=\\\"http://graphql.org/\\\">GraphQL</a>. It allowed us to\\nmanage our data definitions in an easier way. On top of that <a href=\\\"http://graphene-python.org/\\\">Graphene</a> allowed us to parallelize a lot of data fetching.\\nOn the client side it allowed us to evolve our data needs with <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/relay/\\\">Relay</a>.</li>\\n<li>Frontend: We used <a href=\\\"https://reactjs.org/\\\">React</a> to manage our view layer. It\\nallowed us to work well with user interactions. Paired with <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/relay/\\\">Relay</a>, we were able to model user data and\\ninteraction well. The declarative style allowed us to reason about\\nthe data.</li>\\n<li>Documentation: We generated our documentation with Sphinx and deployed it to readthedocs. You can find it <a href=\\\"http://ase4156.readthedocs.io/\\\">here</a>.</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>External Services: We integrated our application with some external services\\nto move critical data away from our responsibility.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://plaid.com/\\\">Plaid</a>: This API allowed us to integrate with real\\nproduction data. Users were able to link our application with their real bank\\naccount.</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in\\\">Google Auth</a>:\\nWe did not want to take the responsibility of authenticating the user, since\\nwe would have to store the password and prevent attacks. Thus instead we went\\nwith Google Authentication. Integrating with the tool was a breeze.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Testing: A major focus of the class was properly testing the application. We\\nwere able to achieve a 96% test coverage.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Python: Django offered an <a href=\\\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/testing/overview/\\\">internal testing tool</a>, but <a href=\\\"https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/\\\">pytest</a> had a better appeal for us, since the test runner is\\nwidely used. Pytest was not always easy to integrate with Django, but it ended up\\nworking for our use cases.</li>\\n<li>Javascript: We used <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/jest/\\\">Jest</a> to test the\\nJavascript side of our application. Combined with <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/snapshot-testing.html\\\">Snapshot Testing</a> we were able\\nto test our client side well. We struggled with testing Relay\\ncomponents. Ultimately we had to add a lot of extra test data to\\nmatch the expected fragments. An example testcase is <a href=\\\"https://github.com/Neitsch/ASE4156/blob/master/web/js/components/InvestBucket/__tests__/InvestBucketRelay-test.jsx\\\">here</a>.</li>\\n<li>Selenium: This served as one of our pillars to verify that our software\\nactually worked. Unit and integration testing took us 90% of the way, but\\nSelenium caught regressions throughout our development process.\\nIt ended up being an important asset.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Infrastructure:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>We hosted our database with <a href=\\\"https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/\\\">GCP SQL</a>, since we had credits there.</li>\\n<li>We did CID through <a href=\\\"https://travis-ci.org/\\\">Travis</a>, since we had positive\\nexperiences with it in the\\npast</li>\\n<li>We hosted our application in <a href=\\\"http://dashboard.heroku.com/\\\">Heroku</a>, since\\nit seamlessly integrated with Travis and managed our application well.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h1 id=\\\"final-result\\\"><a href=\\\"#final-result\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Final result</h1>\\n<p>I am satisfied with the final result.
