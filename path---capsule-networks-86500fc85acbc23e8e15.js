Our main findings were, that CapsNets\nexhibit some very desirable properties, such as resistance to Adversarial\nAttacks and better adaptiveness, but are currently orders of magnitude slower.\nYou can find the full report <a href="/uploads/capsnets.pdf">here</a>.</p>',timeToRead:1,excerpt:"Capsule Networks Capsule Networks are a novel approach for processing data with a neural network.\nThey were first introduced a couple yearsâ€¦",frontmatter:{title:"Capsule Networks",cover:"/img/neural-network.jpg",date:"10/02/2018",category:"tech",tags:["programming","machine learning","neural networks","past project"]},fields:{nextTitle:"Welcome to my Blog",nextSlug:"/welcome-to-my-blog",prevTitle:"Capsule Networks",prevSlug:"/capsule-networks",slug:"/capsule-networks"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/capsule-networks"}}}});
